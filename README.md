# Linear-Optimization (ISYE 6501)

This is a project regarding an example for linear optimization. It dealts with a diet data that contains food items with each price/serving and nutrient information. The optimization goal is to minimize the cost of 1 meal while maintaining the serving to have sufficient nutrients given that we have a daily minimum and maximum bounds for each nutrient.
